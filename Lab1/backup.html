####This is a Copy of my Lab1, When I reopend the file in R studios some charecters such a 'a' or '=' were replaced with question marks, here is a saved version of my results incase the R file handed in was corrupted






#Erik Turchi Lab 1
#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~#

#Q1 import csv files
IBM <- read.csv("IBMStock.csv", header = TRUE)
GE <- read.csv("GEStock.csv", header = TRUE)
ProcterGamble <- read.csv("ProcterGambleStock.csv", header = TRUE)
CocaCola <- read.csv("CocaColaStock.csv", header = TRUE)
Boeing <- read.csv("BoeingStock.csv", header = TRUE)


#Q2 check each data field using str() function
str(IBM)
str(GE)
str(ProcterGamble)
str(CocaCola)
str(Boeing)


#Q3 Clean Data to as.Date Function
GE$Date = as.Date(GE$Date, "%m/%d/%y") 
IBM$Date = as.Date(IBM$Date, "%m/%d/%y") 
ProcterGamble$Date = as.Date(ProcterGamble$Date, "%m/%d/%y") 
CocaCola$Date = as.Date(CocaCola$Date, "%m/%d/%y") 
Boeing$Date = as.Date(Boeing$Date, "%m/%d/%y") 

#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~#
#Warmup and Basic Q's


#1. How many rows of data are in each dataset?
#using the str() function it shows in the console 480 obj(or in this case rows) per data set, as well as 2 columns
str(Boeing)
str(IBM)
str(GE)
str(ProcterGamble)
str(CocaCola)


#2. What is the earliest/latest year in our datasets?
#using the head() and tail() funtions we can assign a value of 1 column to show the earliest and latest peice of data in the datasets
#other datasets using mismatched dates and times can be filtered using queries such as dateORder = order(date) and than arrange(dateOrder)
head(Boeing, 1)
tail(Boeing, 1)

head(CocaCola, 1)
tail(CocaCola, 1)

head(ProcterGamble, 1)
tail(ProcterGamble, 1)

head(IBM, 1)
tail(IBM, 1)

head(GE, 1)
tail(GE, 1)


#3. For the period above what is the average stock price of Coca Cola?
#we can display the average or 'mean' stockprice over the entire dataset of 'CocaCola' with plotmeans 
library(ggplot2)
library(gplots)
plotmeans(StockPrice ~ Date, data = CocaCola, frame = FALSE)

#The mean of the StockPrice Column in CocaCola is 60.03
mean(CocaCola[["StockPrice"]])


#4. What is the maximum price of IBM during this period?
#The max stock price of IBM is 438.90
max(IBM["StockPrice"])


#5. What is the standard deviation of P&G stock price over this period?
#ProcterGamble's standard variation (sq root of varience) is displayed with sd() function and is 18.19
sd(ProcterGamble[["StockPrice"]])


#6. What is the median price of Boeing in the last 5 years for which we have data?
#The median of Boeing from the past 5 years of collected data as 64.96
Boeing2 <- read.csv ("Boeing2004Up.csv", header = TRUE)
Boeing2$Date = as.Date(Boeing2$Date, "%m/%d/%y") 
median(Boeing2[["StockPrice"]])
  
#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~#
#Basic Plotting Questions

#Part 1:  Plot the StockPrice of Coca-Cola on the Y-axis across Date on the x-axis using the basic plot() 


plot(StockPrice ~ Date, data = CocaCola, frame = FALSE)

plot(StockPrice ~ Date, data = CocaCola, type = 'l', frame = TRUE, col="red")
lines(ProcterGamble$Date, ProcterGamble$StockPrice,col="blue")

plotmeans(StockPrice ~ Date, data = CocaCola)


#A1 :  The highest Stock Price Year for coca cola was 1973 and its lowest year being 1980

#A2 :  The highest percentage increase Year OVer Year was 1971 to 1972 with an estimated 55% growth span


#Part 2 : Adding P&G
  
#A1 :  P&G's Stock Dropped More percentage wise than CocaColas

#A2 :  In 1983 CocaColas Stocks Were on the rise as P&G's took a sharp drop

#A3 :  Across the entire plot CocaColas Stocks were a generally lower price

#Data Visualization from 1995 - 2005:


plot(CocaCola$Date[301:432],CocaCola$StockPrice[301:432],type = 'l', col = 'red', ylim=c(0,210))
lines(IBM$Date[301:432],IBM$StockPrice[301:432], col = 'Blue')
lines(ProcterGamble$Date[301:432],ProcterGamble$StockPrice[301:432], col = 'green')
lines(Boeing$Date[301:432],Boeing$StockPrice[301:432], col = 'orange')
lines(GE$Date[301:432],GE$StockPrice[301:432], col = 'purple')


#A1 :  GE's Stock Fell the most right after the 2000 bubble

#A2 :  IBM had the highest price maximum between 1995 and 2005

#A3 :  The companies experiencing a decrease were: IBM, P&G, Boeing, and GE
#      the largest drop experienced was P&G
#      Coca Cola was the only comany that didnt see a massive drop just a tiny bump is a steady growth period

#A4 :  The stock providing the best return in this era belonged to Boeing

#A5 :  IBM had the largest Delta between the max and Min of the stock price

#A6 :  The most coorilated stocks would be GE and P&G

#Monthly Trend Analysis

tapply(IBM$StockPrice, months(IBM$Date), mean, simplify = TRUE)
tapply(CocaCola$StockPrice, months(CocaCola$Date), mean)
tapply(ProcterGamble$StockPrice, months(ProcterGamble$Date), mean)
tapply(Boeing$StockPrice, months(Boeing$Date), mean)
tapply(GE$StockPrice, months(GE$Date), mean)


#A1 :  IBM's Historic 'good' months are January, February, March, April, and May, a historically successful first half to the year

#A2 :  G&E, coca cola, and IBM have very similar high points in the same months: January, February, March, April, and May respectivly

#A3 :  December for every company is a low point aside from but not excluding coca cola(3rd lowest month) It seems december to january 
#      is always a jump upwards in stock prices with most companies almost having their highest averaging months during january
